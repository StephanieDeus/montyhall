Description: The "montyhall" package provides functions to simulate and solve the Monty Hall problem. The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle based on a game show scenario where a contestant is presented with three doors, behind one of which is a valuable prize while the other two doors hide worthless items. After the contestant makes an initial selection, the host, who knows what's behind each door, opens one of the remaining doors to reveal a worthless item. The contestant is then given the opportunity to switch their choice to the remaining unopened door. This package offers functions to simulate multiple iterations of the Monty Hall problem and analyze the outcomes based on different strategies, providing insights into the optimal decision-making approach.
